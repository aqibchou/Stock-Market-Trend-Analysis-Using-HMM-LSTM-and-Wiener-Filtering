## XYZ Format Resume Points (Technical Focus)

### 1. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Architecture Implementation
**Accomplished** state-of-the-art financial time series modeling **as measured by** 80% prediction accuracy and 77.38% cross-validation performance **by doing** implementation of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-HMM with Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, integrating XGBoost for state transition probability estimation and implementing Baum-Welch algorithm for parameter optimization in multi-state financial regime detection.

### 2. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Integration with HMM
**Accomplished** advanced sequence modeling for financial prediction **as measured by** stable convergence and robust performance across market regimes **by doing** development of LSTM-based RNN architecture that processes HMM-derived state probabilities as input features, implementing bidirectional LSTM with dropout regularization, and creating hybrid HMM-LSTM model for capturing both short-term dependencies and long-term temporal patterns in financial time series.

### 3. Signal Processing and Machine Learning Fusion
**Accomplished** noise reduction and signal enhancement **as measured by** improved model convergence and prediction stability **by doing** implementation of adaptive Wiener filtering algorithms for financial time series denoising, integration of signal processing techniques with machine learning pipelines, and development of multi-scale feature extraction combining technical indicators with filtered price signals using Kalman filtering principles and spectral analysis methods.
